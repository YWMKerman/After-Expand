AfterSolarSystemExpand or After Expand (ASSEX for short) is a mod based on the timeline of AfterSolarSystemMod. This mod adds dozens of stars to the solar system. Some of these stars have a large number of stars, some have only a few planets, or no planets; some star systems contain one or more stars, both binary star systems or multiple star systems; there are even black holes or wandering planets. These stars or planets are diverse. These stars or planets are diverse, and their stars cover a large part of the star spectrum types in the Hertz-Rubber diagram, and the planet types cover almost all types of planets currently known to mankind. Some planets are extremely cold, and the hydrosphere on the surface is liquid hydrogen, while some planets are oceans composed of liquid nitrogen. And some planets are ordinary liquid water, or lava... 

Compared with AfterSolarSystem, ASSEX has exerted imagination to a great extent. But not all planets are unscientific and unreasonable. Their existence is physically simulated to ensure the stability of the system before they are added into the game. All celestial bodies are in the proportion of the universe in our real life, without any size scaling.

But it should be noted that when you go to these exoplanets, do not directly use the cheat function to transfer your vehicle directly to the surface of the exoplanet with an atmosphere, because this is likely to cause game bugs and your vehicle Tools will be destroyed by air resistance. At the same time, if you teleport directly, the texture of the planet's surface will not be loaded in time, and a mosaic-like surface texture will appear. In general, it is recommended that when you use the cheat function to go to these planets, you first teleport to the orbit of the planet you want to land, and then manually land or use the cheat function again to teleport to the surface.Another thing to mention is that after KerbalSpaceProgram version 1.8, the game changed the way terrain is generated, which means that when you go to extremely distant planets, the accuracy will overflow, which means there will be terrain faults, or you will not be able to drive a vehicle, or you will not be able to drive a vehicle. Or your vehicle will be destroyed not far from the ground. But this seems to be probabilistic? It has not happened on my computer.

Finally, ASSEX is not entirely built by YWMKerman, the author of AfterSolarSystem. It is theoretically a fan work of AfterSolarSystem, completed by Linhu Fox, and YWMKerman is responsible for collaboration and technical support. Due to optimization and Mod size issues, if you feel that the content quality is far inferior to AfterSolarSystem, please understand.
