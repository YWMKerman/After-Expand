This is a sphere composed of hot plasma, but it is not a perfect sphere. Due to the extremely high rotation speed, its shape is an ellipsoid with a significant bulge at the equator. Heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. Moryan radiates energy mainly in the form of visible light, ultraviolet and infrared rays, and is the most important energy source for life on earth. Moryan's radius is approximately 813,600 kilometers (polar radius). Its mass is approximately 2.35E+10 kg. Moryan is an F-type main sequence star (F9V) whose light is actually white and is therefore informally, and not entirely accurately, called a yellow-white dwarf. It was formed approximately 0.45 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within the macromolecular cloud region. Most of the matter is concentrated in the center, while the rest is flattened into an orbital disk, evolving into the Moryan System. The central mass becomes so hot and dense that it eventually initiates nuclear fusion in its core. In the core of this star, approximately hundreds of millions of tons of hydrogen are fused into helium every second, converting 5 million tons of matter into energy in the process. This energy may take 10,000 to 170,000 years to escape the core and is the source of Moryan's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core is reduced to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will experience a significant increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, ultimately transforming Moryan into a red giant star, as seen in our night sky today The brightest star seen in - Like the Sun, that star is 0.8 light years away from us. It was once a G2V star, about 10 billion years old, and about 18% less massive than our Moryan. When it reached the end of its life After it came to an end, it expanded rapidly, swallowing up the two planets in their star system, and became 2,000 times brighter than before. Quality is also lost by almost 20%. That bright star is the brightest star in our night sky and what our parent star will look like in the future.
