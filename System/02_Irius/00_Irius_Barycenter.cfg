In the following years, they will slowly cool down and their brightness will become dimmer and dimmer until they finally disappear from human vision. But today's humans would never have thought that one of the white dwarfs was a red supergiant at some point billions of years ago, so bright that it could be seen during the day.  \n But soon after the death of this pair of stars, later generations forgot its former name, so they gave the pair of stars a cold and ruthless number as a name.
