# _***Overview :***_
_AfterSolarSystemExpand (hereinafter referred to as ASSEX) is a Mod based on YWMKerman's Mod: AfterSolarSystem. It belongs to the DLC of AfterSolarSystem Mod. If you want to play this Mod, you must use the main Mod: AfterSolarSystem._

_This mod is a fan mod of AfterSolarSystem Mod. Its story setting is not entirely made by YWMKerman, but by another founder: "玲狐子", Because of this, the visual effect of ASSEX may not be as good as AfterSolarSystem, please understand._

_In this mod, it adds multiple additional star systems to the originally monotonous solar system. Their scales are the same as AfterSolarSystem, which are all real universe scales based on real astrophysics, rather than the unscientific scales in the inventory system._

# _***Content :***_
_The following star systems are the star systems added by ASSEX for AfterSolarSystem:_

 - ## ***Moryan System***
   ![Moryan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d9076d-6334-4d23-b2d4-222aaaf8a456)
(An F9V main sequence star with multiple large planets, among which the satellite Morleng of the gas giant Moryann is a potential harbor for life. In addition, there is a high-gravity celestial body with 6 times the mass of the Earth and 1.5 times the radius of the Earth, a super ocean planet with about 15 times the mass of the Earth, a gas giant with 5 times the mass of Jupiter, and so on... They add a lot of challenges to the lonely game.)
