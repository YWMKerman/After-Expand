        #ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_name = ω Milkdromeda
		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_desc = ω Milkdromeda is a pair of star systems that are relatively close to us. It is also the brightest star system we can see. The star system consists of three stars, one is a dead white dwarf, one is a red giant that is experiencing its last glory, and the other is a red dwarf in the main sequence stage. The age of these three stars is only a few hundred million years older than the sun... \n\nThe bright light we see from ω Milkdromeda is actually emitted by the red giant of this system.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A_name = ω Milkdromeda A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A_desc = ω Milkdromeda A is a white dwarf star that just ended its last glory not long ago. After the huge red giant shell was blown away, a core only slightly larger than the Earth was exposed. Its appearance marks the complete end of a star's life. At present, the core of this star composed of carbon elements is still very hot, but it has lost its energy supply. In the days to come, it will slowly cool down until it finally becomes a large diamond that does not shine. \n\n<color=#BFCCFE>It is very dangerous, please be careful.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B_name = ω Milkdromeda B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B_desc = ω Milkdromeda B is a red giant, or more precisely. It is currently experiencing the last glorious moment of a star, which is also the most unstable moment in its life. In the last moment, it will become thousands of times brighter than ever before. But it will not be long before it becomes a white dwarf, and eventually the star will not be visible to the naked eye.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_name = ω Milkdromeda B b
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_desc = This hot planet will once again witness the end of a star's final glory, perhaps it is the last surviving planet in this system - a planet only slightly larger than Mars, but with a slightly higher gravity than Earth. \n We have reason to suspect that this planet was much larger than it is now, even a gas planet or the remnant of an ice giant, but the planetary nebula produced in the last glory of the system's main star tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago stripped away its thick atmosphere and its crust.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_name = ω Milkdromeda C c
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_desc = This is a planet that died young, its iron core not surviving the turbulent times of the red dwarf star below. The final result is: the strong stellar wind stripped away its original atmosphere, and the strong radiation eroded the rocks on its surface bit by bit, turning it into a desolate world filled with radiation and baked by ultraviolet rays. Perhaps this is why this planet looks so dark.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_C_name = ω Milkdromeda C
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_C_desc = ω Milkdromeda C is a dim red dwarf star, the last star we have discovered and confirmed in this system, and the last remaining main sequence star in this system, but don't worry, it has only completed less than 3% of the life of the main sequence star. There is still a long way to go. This makes the colonization of the two Earth-like planets around this planet possible, but we can't stay here for a long time, because the strong stellar wind and frequent coronal mass ejections may destroy our spacecraft. It's also impossible to wait for the star to stabilize, because its planetary atmosphere will have been blown dry before then.

        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_name = ω Milkdromeda C b
        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_desc = This gas planet in the distant orbit of ω Milkdromeda C is the first planet we have discovered in this star system. Due to its extremely long distance from us, it has always been shrouded in a veil of mystery, and we can hardly explore this gas planet too much, but with the help of weak starlight, we still found that there is a huge halo around this gas planet, reflecting a dim light blue light in the background starlight.  \n\n<color=#C4A489>Its gravity is very close to that of the Earth in our solar system. Perhaps you can fly in the atmosphere of this gaseous planet like we did on Earth in the past. Because of this, we can better enter its atmosphere to obtain hydrogen and methane, which are valuable energy sources for space travel.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_name = ω Milkdromeda C d
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_desc = ω Milkdromeda C d is a super-Earth orbiting a red dwarf star. It is also the closest planet to us orbiting a main sequence star. With the help of its strong gravity and thick atmosphere, the planet survived the instability of the violent coronal mass ejection from the main sequence star. Although its atmosphere is much thinner than it once was, its atmospheric thickness and temperature are still rated as potentially habitable objects by us. It will be the first stop we go to after leaving the solar system.

        #ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_name = Irius 
		#ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_desc = This is a pair of binary star systems that died young. They ended their red giant stage hundreds of millions of years ago and turned into white dwarfs. In the following years, they will slowly cool down and their brightness will become dimmer and dimmer until they finally disappear from human vision. But today's humans would never have thought that one of the white dwarfs was a red supergiant at some point billions of years ago, so bright that it could be seen during the day.  \n But soon after the death of this pair of stars, later generations forgot its former name, so they gave the pair of stars a cold and ruthless number as a name.

        #ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_name = Irius A
		#ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_desc = A star that was once the brightest in the night sky, shining in the direction of human progress, but then it died. Humans in the solar system have gradually forgotten it as centuries pass, but the universe will not forget its existence. It will continue to fly alone in this galaxy cantilever together with another white dwarf star that passed away earlier.

        #ASSEX_IriusB_name = Irius B
		#ASSEX_IriusB_desc = This white dwarf was the first to die in this star system, and it was also the most massive existence in this star system. However, it died young and stayed in the main sequence belt for only 100 million years, and then ended its life as a star. The life of a main sequence star. Now, almost more than 8 billion years have passed, and the white dwarf has dropped from hundreds of thousands of degrees Celsius at the beginning to more than 6,000 degrees Celsius today... But the cooling has not stopped, it continues to cool down. Perhaps we will never see the day when it goes out again.

        #ASSEX_MoryanB_name = Predator 
		#ASSEX_MoryanB_desc = This is a dying star. It has been separated from the main sequence as early as 10 billion years ago. During this long period of time, due to the continuous radiation emitted, its temperature is slowly decreasing. It is currently the lowest mass and lowest temperature white dwarf we have ever seen. At present, it is passing through the nearest star system - Moryan at a high speed. At this time, if you look up from a certain planet in the solar system to the night sky, you will find that it forms a visual double star with Moryan. Of course, you cannot see it with the naked eye.     

        #ASSEX_Luji'StarBarycenter_name = Luji's Star
		#ASSEX_Luji'StarBarycenter_desc = This may be the closest brown dwarf system to us, but as time goes by, they are also cooling, dimming, and eventually disappearing in the sky. This pair of lonely brown dwarf systems may be being forgotten by us

        #ASSEX_Luji'sStarA_name = Luji's Star A
		#ASSEX_Luji'sStarA_desc = The only faint dark red light left from this brown dwarf is our last chance to see it, but the last time will be short. It is also cooling now, but the speed of cooling is slightly slower than that of its companion star.

        #ASSEX_Luji'sStarB_name = Luji's Star B
		#ASSEX_Luji'sStarB_desc = This is a brown dwarf that is about to go out. Because it cannot reach the mass to ignite hydrogen, it has begun to cool since its birth. After hundreds of millions of years of cooling, its temperature is now very, very low. Now you can hardly see it even with an ordinary astronomical telescope. Because the brightness of the visible light it currently emits is already very weak. \nIt won't be long before it completely disappears in the sky and disappears in our visible light band. \n\nWill people forget about this star by then? We don't know.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeer_name = ShuGeer' s Star
		#ASSEX_ShuGeer_desc = This is a fast-rotating, dim red dwarf star; it is relatively close to us and is still relatively young. Naturally, it will occasionally emit strong flares and stellar winds. These deadly jets will destroy the magnetic fields and atmospheres of all nearby planets. Therefore, the planets in this star system may be desolate, dead, and radiation-filled worlds. \n Despite this, this star system is still worth exploring, challenging the limits and the unknown.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerb_name = ShuGeer' s Star b
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerb_desc = This is a celestial body destroyed by a red dwarf star. During the pre-main sequence stage that lasted for hundreds of millions of years, the frequent flares of the star and the solar wind eruptions continuously stripped away its atmosphere and weakened its magnetic field. Eventually, the original thick atmosphere of the planet disappeared completely. If there was water on this planet, it would have evaporated. Now, it has become a dry world. \n But on the other side of the planet, where the star can never shine, there may still be solidified water.

        #ASSEX_Solitude_name = Solitude
		#ASSEX_Solitude_desc = This is the nearest wandering planet to us. According to our density analysis, it is a rocky planet. It is the largest rocky planet with the largest radius and mass that we have discovered so far. Now it is walking alone in this lonely universe. It may have been thrown out of its original star system billions of years ago. \n Now that it has lost the heating and illumination of the star, its temperature is very low. It only relies on weak geothermal heat to prevent it from reaching absolute zero. Despite this, its temperature is still very low. The surface is pitch black, and its horizon can only be seen clearly by the faint light of stars. \n\nAt such a low temperature, even our common hydrogen becomes liquid here. It's very dark on the surface, with no lighting, so be careful if you try to land!

        #ASSEX_1007J2_name = SEQ 1056-0700/J2
		#ASSEX_1007J2_desc = This is a star that is relatively close to us, and its spectrum is: F6 IV/V. Unfortunately, it has just finished the main sequence star stage and is entering the subgiant stage. The two giant hot Jupiters that once destroyed all the planets in this planetary system will soon also usher in their destruction. \n However, their end is not to be swallowed by the star, but to fall into the star due to tidal force.

        #ASSEX_1007J2b_name = SEQ 1056-0700/J2 b
		#ASSEX_1007J2b_desc = This is a dying gas planet, its mass is much higher than Jupiter in our solar system. Its mass is even close to the minimum limit of brown dwarf. But because it was formed too quickly, nothing could stop it after it was formed. After that, it began to approach the star below, and the speed of "falling" became faster and faster... \nFinally, it came to the current position, but the "fall" has not stopped. It will continue to fall. In about 4 million years, it will completely hit the star below and eventually disappear in the universe.

		#ASSEX_1007J2c_desc = SEQ 1056-0700/J2 c is the second planet we discovered in this system. Like the first one, it is still a hot Jupiter, but its mass is much lower than that of the first planet. Only its less than 1/10, but the radius is half that of SEQ 1056-0700/J2 b. \nThis shows that the density of this planet is very low, and its atmosphere expands rapidly at such a high temperature, resulting in a significant increase in the "radius" of the planet. \n\n Because it is slightly farther away and its density is very low, it will not continue to fall into the star like SEQ 1056-0700/J2 b, but will eventually be torn apart by the star. \n\n<color=#970000> Can your spacecraft withstand this high temperature? If it can, maybe we can try to fly at the height of this planet's atmosphere. Because at such a high temperature, the speed of sound will become very large. Of course, you can't dive into its core because the atmosphere is too thick.

        #ASSEX_1120X_name = BH 1103-2019/X
		#ASSEX_1120X_desc = This is the closest black hole to us and is one of the top three most massive objects in this open cluster. Although its mass is 7 times larger than our sun when it was a main sequence star, and although it is less than 10 light years away from us, it will not approach us in the foreseeable future. In short, its existence will not pose a threat to our star system and all members of this open cluster. \n\n Please note that this black hole will exert extremely strong tidal and destructive forces on the spacecraft! If you get close to it, it may cause the navigation equipment carried on your spacecraft to malfunction, so be careful!

        #ASSEX_0117J1_name = SEQ 0139-1757/J1
		#ASSEX_0117J1_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 is a pair of binary stars less than 9 light years away from us. They are very similar to our sun 7.9 billion years ago in terms of mass, spectrum, or radius, which is a G-type main sequence star. Although this star system has only one planet, this huge planet is located in its habitable zone. If this planet has a large satellite, it may be possible for life to exist.

        #ASSEX_0117J1A_name =  SEQ 0139-1757/J1 A
		#ASSEX_0117J1A_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 A is a member of the binary star system SEQ 0139-1757/J1. It is the most massive star in this star system. It is also very similar to our sun (main sequence stage). In such a similar situation, it greatly increases our hope for this system. \nAfter our radial velocity method calculation, it shows that there is a huge gas planet in the orbit not far away. According to our model of the star, this gas planet is located in the habitable zone, which may lay a certain foundation for the existence of life. Of course, if this gas planet has a satellite of suitable size, we may be able to colonize it directly.

        #ASSEX_0117J1B_name = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 B
		#ASSEX_0117J1B_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 B is one of the stars in a binary system. Its mass, radius, and even spectrum are very similar to our Sun (main sequence stage). It takes about 2 months for it to orbit another slightly more massive star. This distance is almost close to each other on a cosmic scale. Such a close distance will cause the orbit of the spacecraft to be seriously disturbed if you try to approach it alone, which may lead to danger. Generally, we do not recommend orbiting a star alone.

        #ASSEX_0117J1ABb_name = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b
		#ASSEX_0117J1ABb_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b is a "warm Jupiter", a gas giant like Jupiter, but with temperatures close to those suitable for life. We agree that this planet could not have been born directly here, because it is within the snow line and cannot accrete to become a gas planet in its current orbit. Therefore, we speculate that it also went through a journey similar to hot Jupiters, forming from a farther distance, then migrating inwards, and finally stopping at its current location. \n\n If this is true, then it may have damaged and destroyed a large number of smaller objects during its inward migration, and none of them were spared. \n\n But fortunately, we found a large object in the orbit of this gas planet, which is a rocky object with a thick atmosphere. Could this indicate that this is one of the captured planets? . A gas planet in the habitable zone with a planet with a thick atmosphere and a temperature close to room temperature may give us great hope.

		#ASSEX_0117J1ABbb_desc = This satellite is the only satellite of SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b that has an atmosphere. Since its parent planet is in the habitable zone, the possibility of this planet with a thick atmosphere being suitable for life has suddenly increased. The methane and ammonia we found in the atmosphere of this satellite also confirmed this, although this arid world currently has no liquid water ocean.

		#ASSEX_0117J1ABbc_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b_c is a vacuum rock satellite. Due to the lack of atmosphere protection, if you get close to it, you will find that its surface is covered with many dense craters. In addition, its surface is also covered with a layer of khaki "dust", which has a low reflectivity, which is why this satellite appears so dim from space. \n In addition, according to our calculations, the density of this planet is found to be low, which may indicate that no heavy elements sank into its core when the planet was formed. In other words, this planet is very short of metal resources. If you try to mine ore here, it may be in vain.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gc_desc = This is a dark red asteroid in a relatively distant orbit, and under normal circumstances you can barely see it because it's so small and so dim due to its low albedo. \nAlthough it looks small, its mass is very high compared to other asteroids of equal radius. In this case, a large part of the material that makes up its surface is metal or even entirely composed of metal. This is going to be a huge space gem for us. If we can get close to it and mine it, we may be able to extract many precious metals.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gd_desc = This massive fragment is the second-largest moon in the planetary system (if you include its companion star) and the largest in the entire star system. But its composition is completely different from other satellites. Its main component is ice, which is why it is so huge and has such a low mass. \n But in fact, we still don't know why there is such a large "radius" cliff in this star system? That is, the radius of the celestial body suddenly jumps directly from about 100 kilometers to thousands of kilometers, and no celestial body with any intermediate value can be found.
