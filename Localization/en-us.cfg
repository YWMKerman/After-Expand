        #ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_name = ω Milkdromeda
		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_desc = ω Milkdromeda is a pair of star systems that are relatively close to us. It is also the brightest star system we can see. The star system consists of three stars, one is a dead white dwarf, one is a red giant that is experiencing its last glory, and the other is a red dwarf in the main sequence stage. The age of these three stars is only a few hundred million years older than the sun... \n\nThe bright light we see from ω Milkdromeda is actually emitted by the red giant of this system.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A_name = ω Milkdromeda A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A_desc = ω Milkdromeda A is a white dwarf star that just ended its last glory not long ago. After the huge red giant shell was blown away, a core only slightly larger than the Earth was exposed. Its appearance marks the complete end of a star's life. At present, the core of this star composed of carbon elements is still very hot, but it has lost its energy supply. In the days to come, it will slowly cool down until it finally becomes a large diamond that does not shine. \n\n<color=#BFCCFE>It is very dangerous, please be careful.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B_name = ω Milkdromeda B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B_desc = ω Milkdromeda B is a red giant, or more precisely. It is currently experiencing the last glorious moment of a star, which is also the most unstable moment in its life. In the last moment, it will become thousands of times brighter than ever before. But it will not be long before it becomes a white dwarf, and eventually the star will not be visible to the naked eye.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_name = ω Milkdromeda B b
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_desc = This hot planet will once again witness the end of a star's final glory, perhaps it is the last surviving planet in this system - a planet only slightly larger than Mars, but with a slightly higher gravity than Earth. \n We have reason to suspect that this planet was much larger than it is now, even a gas planet or the remnant of an ice giant, but the planetary nebula produced in the last glory of the system's main star tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago stripped away its thick atmosphere and its crust.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_name = ω Milkdromeda C c
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_desc = This is a planet that died young, its iron core not surviving the turbulent times of the red dwarf star below. The final result is: the strong stellar wind stripped away its original atmosphere, and the strong radiation eroded the rocks on its surface bit by bit, turning it into a desolate world filled with radiation and baked by ultraviolet rays. Perhaps this is why this planet looks so dark.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_C_name = ω Milkdromeda C
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_C_desc = ω Milkdromeda C is a dim red dwarf star, the last star we have discovered and confirmed in this system, and the last remaining main sequence star in this system, but don't worry, it has only completed less than 3% of the life of the main sequence star. There is still a long way to go. This makes the colonization of the two Earth-like planets around this planet possible, but we can't stay here for a long time, because the strong stellar wind and frequent coronal mass ejections may destroy our spacecraft. It's also impossible to wait for the star to stabilize, because its planetary atmosphere will have been blown dry before then.

        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_name = ω Milkdromeda C b
        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_desc = This gas planet in the distant orbit of ω Milkdromeda C is the first planet we have discovered in this star system. Due to its extremely long distance from us, it has always been shrouded in a veil of mystery, and we can hardly explore this gas planet too much, but with the help of weak starlight, we still found that there is a huge halo around this gas planet, reflecting a dim light blue light in the background starlight.  \n\n<color=#C4A489>Its gravity is very close to that of the Earth in our solar system. Perhaps you can fly in the atmosphere of this gaseous planet like we did on Earth in the past. Because of this, we can better enter its atmosphere to obtain hydrogen and methane, which are valuable energy sources for space travel.

		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_desc = ω Milkdromeda C d is a super-Earth orbiting a red dwarf star. It is also the closest planet to us orbiting a main sequence star. With the help of its strong gravity and thick atmosphere, the planet survived the instability of the violent coronal mass ejection from the main sequence star. Although its atmosphere is much thinner than it once was, its atmospheric thickness and temperature are still rated as potentially habitable objects by us. It will be the first stop we go to after leaving the solar system.

        #ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_name = Irius 
		#ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_desc = This is a pair of binary star systems that died young. They ended their red giant stage hundreds of millions of years ago and turned into white dwarfs. In the following years, they will slowly cool down and their brightness will become dimmer and dimmer until they finally disappear from human vision. But today's humans would never have thought that one of the white dwarfs was a red supergiant at some point billions of years ago, so bright that it could be seen during the day.  \n But soon after the death of this pair of stars, later generations forgot its former name, so they gave the pair of stars a cold and ruthless number as a name.

        #ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_name = Irius A
		#ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_desc = A star that was once the brightest in the night sky, shining in the direction of human progress, but then it died. Humans in the solar system have gradually forgotten it as centuries pass, but the universe will not forget its existence. It will continue to fly alone in this galaxy cantilever together with another white dwarf star that passed away earlier.

        #ASSEX_IriusB_name = Irius B
		#ASSEX_IriusB_desc = This white dwarf was the first to die in this star system, and it was also the most massive existence in this star system. However, it died young and stayed in the main sequence belt for only 100 million years, and then ended its life as a star. The life of a main sequence star. Now, almost more than 8 billion years have passed, and the white dwarf has dropped from hundreds of thousands of degrees Celsius at the beginning to more than 6,000 degrees Celsius today... But the cooling has not stopped, it continues to cool down. Perhaps we will never see the day when it goes out again.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeer_name = Nadeba' s Star
		#ASSEX_ShuGeer_desc = This is a red dwarf star with a very large proper motion in the sky, which passed by our solar system at a very fast speed. At present, this red dwarf is very old and is close to the end of its main sequence. Although it now seems to be very stable and has no violent flares, the atmospheres of all the planets in its star system have been destroyed by it in its youth.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerb_name = Nadeba' s Star b
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerb_desc = This is a celestial body destroyed by a red dwarf star. During the pre-main sequence stage that lasted for hundreds of millions of years, the frequent flares of the star and the solar wind eruptions continuously stripped away its atmosphere and weakened its magnetic field. Eventually, the original thick atmosphere of the planet disappeared completely. If there was water on this planet, it would have evaporated. Now, it has become a dry world. \n But on the other side of the planet, where the star can never shine, there may still be solidified water.

		#ASSEX_ShuGeerc_desc = This old planet was destroyed by a violent flare ejected from this star system billions of years ago. Its thick atmosphere was stripped away and its rotation was locked.

		#ASSEX_ShuGeerd_desc = This planet may be the densest in the system. It orbits very close to its parent star, making it tidally locked. This leads to extreme temperature differences between the sunlit and dark sides of the planet, with temperatures on the sunlit side estimated to reach 500 degrees Celsius. \nAlthough its color appears to be burning, we do not consider it dangerous.

Even though, due to the low radiation levels of its parent star, and even though it orbits so close, the planet is right on the edge of its parent star's habitable zone, we don't think it's habitable.

        #ASSEX_Faggarden's Starb_name = Faggarden's Star b
		#ASSEX_Faggarden's Starb_desc = This planet is wrapped in a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, forming an extreme greenhouse effect environment. The thick clouds cover the sky and even if you are on the sun-facing side of the planet, you will find that its daytime is as dark as night. We still know nothing about what the world is like beneath a thick atmosphere.

	    #ASSEX_Faggarden'sStard_desc = This is a distant icy world that has been quietly operating outside the snow line of this distant red dwarf star system. Due to the unique inclination of the planetary disk of this star system, we cannot observe it through the traditional "transit method", but it is observed and confirmed by the "radial velocity method". Therefore, due to its slightly lower mass, this icy world was not discovered until the end.

        #ASSEX_Ceticus_name = Ceticus
		#ASSEX_Ceticus_desc = This is a star less than 12 light-years away from us. Not long ago, it just ended the craziest Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of its life... Now, the hot outer shell has faded, revealing a naked, extremely hot core, but this is still not the end. It is currently burning helium, and this will be its last light. Soon, it will continue to collapse, ultimately becoming a white dwarf, concluding its long life.

        #ASSEX_Ceticusf_name = Ceticus f
		#ASSEX_Ceticusf_desc = Canglong 5 f may be the only surviving rocky planet in this star system. Its distant orbit has allowed it to escape the engulfment of its parent star. Despite this, the intense stellar radiation still heats it to thousands of degrees Celsius and strips away its atmosphere. \n\nAt this moment, it quietly floats in the distant orbit of the blue dwarf star, rotating alone and cooling down. The extremely high gravity may be a luxury for explorers.

		#ASSEX_0117J1_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 is a pair of binary stars less than 9 light years away from us. They are very similar to our sun 7.9 billion years ago in terms of mass, spectrum, or radius, which is a G-type main sequence star. Although this star system has only one planet, this huge planet is located in its habitable zone. If this planet has a large satellite, it may be possible for life to exist.

        #ASSEX_0117J1A_name =  SEQ 0139-1757/J1 A
		#ASSEX_0117J1A_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 A is a member of the binary star system SEQ 0139-1757/J1. It is the most massive star in this star system. It is also very similar to our sun (main sequence stage). In such a similar situation, it greatly increases our hope for this system. \nAfter our radial velocity method calculation, it shows that there is a huge gas planet in the orbit not far away. According to our model of the star, this gas planet is located in the habitable zone, which may lay a certain foundation for the existence of life. Of course, if this gas planet has a satellite of suitable size, we may be able to colonize it directly.

        #ASSEX_0117J1B_name = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 B
		#ASSEX_0117J1B_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 B is one of the stars in a binary system. Its mass, radius, and even spectrum are very similar to our Sun (main sequence stage). It takes about 2 months for it to orbit another slightly more massive star. This distance is almost close to each other on a cosmic scale. Such a close distance will cause the orbit of the spacecraft to be seriously disturbed if you try to approach it alone, which may lead to danger. Generally, we do not recommend orbiting a star alone.

        #ASSEX_0117J1ABb_name = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b
		#ASSEX_0117J1ABb_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b is a "warm Jupiter", a gas giant like Jupiter, but with temperatures close to those suitable for life. We agree that this planet could not have been born directly here, because it is within the snow line and cannot accrete to become a gas planet in its current orbit. Therefore, we speculate that it also went through a journey similar to hot Jupiters, forming from a farther distance, then migrating inwards, and finally stopping at its current location. \n\n If this is true, then it may have damaged and destroyed a large number of smaller objects during its inward migration, and none of them were spared. \n\n But fortunately, we found a large object in the orbit of this gas planet, which is a rocky object with a thick atmosphere. Could this indicate that this is one of the captured planets? . A gas planet in the habitable zone with a planet with a thick atmosphere and a temperature close to room temperature may give us great hope.

Since its parent planet is in the habitable zone, the possibility of this planet with a thick atmosphere being suitable for life has suddenly increased. The methane and ammonia we found in the atmosphere of this satellite also confirmed this, although this arid world currently has no liquid water ocean.

		#ASSEX_0117J1ABbc_desc = SEQ 0139-1757/J1 AB-b_c is a vacuum rock satellite. Due to the lack of atmosphere protection, if you get close to it, you will find that its surface is covered with many dense craters. In addition, its surface is also covered with a layer of khaki "dust", which has a low reflectivity, which is why this satellite appears so dim from space. \n In addition, according to our calculations, the density of this planet is found to be low, which may indicate that no heavy elements sank into its core when the planet was formed. In other words, this planet is very short of metal resources. If you try to mine ore here, it may be in vain.

According to the normal satellite formation method, it is theoretically impossible to form such a large satellite. We ruled out the possibility of capture because the moon's orbit is tilted almost at the same angle as the planet's equator... but regardless, it does appear to be in orbit around the giant gas planet, and it has no atmosphere. Such a large size plus the lack of atmosphere will add a lot of difficulty and challenges to our exploration of this satellite. Be careful if you try to challenge it.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gb_desc= This dark red vacuum object is a companion to the giant rocky planet below. It formed with that planet. At the beginning of its formation, it was located more distant than it is today, but as time went by, it began to slowly approach the main star. As it approached, the tidal force generated by the two giant planets also caused their rotation speed to become faster and faster. Slowly and slowly, now, while they remain where they are now, the two of them are also tidally locked to each other. It reflects a dark red glow in the light of the star below, but we wouldn't normally think of it as a dangerous world.  \n\n<color=#A30000> Need to be careful! The surface of this vacuum bare rock world is very uneven, with a large number of craters and uneven hills. If you try to make a soft landing instead of an emergency landing, please be careful.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gc_desc = This is a dark red asteroid in a relatively distant orbit, and under normal circumstances you can barely see it because it's so small and so dim due to its low albedo. \nAlthough it looks small, its mass is very high compared to other asteroids of equal radius. In this case, a large part of the material that makes up its surface is metal or even entirely composed of metal. This is going to be a huge space gem for us. If we can get close to it and mine it, we may be able to extract many precious metals.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gd_desc = This massive fragment is the second-largest moon in the planetary system (if you include its companion star) and the largest in the entire star system. But its composition is completely different from other satellites. Its main component is ice, which is why it is so huge and has such a low mass. \n But in fact, we still don't know why there is such a large "radius" cliff in this star system? That is, the radius of the celestial body suddenly jumps directly from about 100 kilometers to thousands of kilometers, and no celestial body with any intermediate value can be found.
