        #ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_name = ω Milkdromeda
		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_desc = ω Milkdromeda is a pair of star systems that are relatively close to us. It is also the brightest star system we can see. The star system consists of three stars, one is a dead white dwarf, one is a red giant that is experiencing its last glory, and the other is a red dwarf in the main sequence stage. The age of these three stars is only a few hundred million years older than the sun... \n\nThe bright light we see from ω Milkdromeda is actually emitted by the red giant of this system.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A_name = ω Milkdromeda A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A_desc = ω Milkdromeda A is a white dwarf star that just ended its last glory not long ago. After the huge red giant shell was blown away, a core only slightly larger than the Earth was exposed. Its appearance marks the complete end of a star's life. At present, the core of this star composed of carbon elements is still very hot, but it has lost its energy supply. In the days to come, it will slowly cool down until it finally becomes a large diamond that does not shine. \n\n<color=#BFCCFE>It is very dangerous, please be careful.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B_name = ω Milkdromeda B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B_desc = ω Milkdromeda B is a red giant, or more precisely. It is currently experiencing the last glorious moment of a star, which is also the most unstable moment in its life. In the last moment, it will become thousands of times brighter than ever before. But it will not be long before it becomes a white dwarf, and eventually the star will not be visible to the naked eye.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_name = ω Milkdromeda B b
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Bb_desc = This hot planet will once again witness the end of a star's final glory, perhaps it is the last surviving planet in this system - a planet only slightly larger than Mars, but with a slightly higher gravity than Earth. \n We have reason to suspect that this planet was much larger than it is now, even a gas planet or the remnant of an ice giant, but the planetary nebula produced in the last glory of the system's main star tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago stripped away its thick atmosphere and its crust.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_name = ω Milkdromeda C c
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_desc = This is a planet that died young, its iron core not surviving the turbulent times of the red dwarf star below. The final result is: the strong stellar wind stripped away its original atmosphere, and the strong radiation eroded the rocks on its surface bit by bit, turning it into a desolate world filled with radiation and baked by ultraviolet rays. Perhaps this is why this planet looks so dark.

		#ASSEX_ωMilk_C_desc = ω Milkdromeda C is a dim red dwarf star, the last star we have discovered and confirmed in this system, and the last remaining main sequence star in this system, but don't worry, it has only completed less than 3% of the life of the main sequence star. There is still a long way to go. This makes the colonization of the two Earth-like planets around this planet possible, but we can't stay here for a long time, because the strong stellar wind and frequent coronal mass ejections may destroy our spacecraft. It's also impossible to wait for the star to stabilize, because its planetary atmosphere will have been blown dry before then.

        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_name = ω Milkdromeda C b
        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_desc = This gas planet in the distant orbit of ω Milkdromeda C is the first planet we have discovered in this star system. Due to its extremely long distance from us, it has always been shrouded in a veil of mystery, and we can hardly explore this gas planet too much, but with the help of weak starlight, we still found that there is a huge halo around this gas planet, reflecting a dim light blue light in the background starlight.  \n\n<color=#C4A489>Its gravity is very close to that of the Earth in our solar system. Perhaps you can fly in the atmosphere of this gaseous planet like we did on Earth in the past. Because of this, we can better enter its atmosphere to obtain hydrogen and methane, which are valuable energy sources for space travel.

		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_desc = ω Milkdromeda C d is a super-Earth orbiting a red dwarf star. It is also the closest planet to us orbiting a main sequence star. With the help of its strong gravity and thick atmosphere, the planet survived the instability of the violent coronal mass ejection from the main sequence star. Although its atmosphere is much thinner than it once was, its atmospheric thickness and temperature are still rated as potentially habitable objects by us. It will be the first stop we go to after leaving the solar system.

		#ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_desc = This is a pair of binary star systems that died young. They ended their red giant stage hundreds of millions of years ago and turned into white dwarfs. In the following years, they will slowly cool down and their brightness will become dimmer and dimmer until they finally disappear from human vision. But today's humans would never have thought that one of the white dwarfs was a red supergiant at some point billions of years ago, so bright that it could be seen during the day.  \n But soon after the death of this pair of stars, later generations forgot its former name, so they gave the pair of stars a cold and ruthless number as a name.

        #ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_name = WD 0645-1643 A
		#ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_desc = A star that was once the brightest in the night sky, shining in the direction of human progress, but then it died. Humans in the solar system have gradually forgotten it as centuries pass, but the universe will not forget its existence. It will continue to fly alone in this galaxy cantilever together with another white dwarf star that passed away earlier.

        #ASSEX_IriusB_name = WD 0645-1643 B
		#ASSEX_IriusB_desc = This white dwarf was the first to die in this star system, and it was also the most massive existence in this star system. However, it died young and stayed in the main sequence belt for only 100 million years, and then ended its life as a star. The life of a main sequence star. Now, almost more than 8 billion years have passed, and the white dwarf has dropped from hundreds of thousands of degrees Celsius at the beginning to more than 6,000 degrees Celsius today... But the cooling has not stopped, it continues to cool down. Perhaps we will never see the day when it goes out again.

		#ASSEX_MoryanB_desc = This is a dying star. It has been separated from the main sequence as early as 10 billion years ago. During this long period of time, due to the continuous radiation emitted, its temperature is slowly decreasing. It is currently the lowest mass and lowest temperature white dwarf we have ever seen. At present, it is passing through the nearest star system - Moryan at a high speed. At this time, if you look up from a certain planet in the solar system to the night sky, you will find that it forms a visual double star with Moryan. Of course, you cannot see it with the naked eye.

		#ASSEX_Moryan_desc = This is a new star. The star system it is in has just stabilized and everything is in order. In the next period of time, it will steadily emit light and heat outward...  \n What will happen in the future is unknown, only time will tell.

		#ASSEX_Rle_desc = For this celestial body that is not even as big as our spacecraft, should we call it a satellite or dust? It's simply so small that it was the last moon we discovered in this binary planet system. Even the probes that explore it have to be very careful when going there, because they can easily break into pieces. \n \nBut we have to go there, where the secrets of the formation of this star system may be recorded, but most of these fragments have been thrown away.

This is a celestial body composed of hexane ice. Although it is very small, our sky survey telescope can still barely discover it. It is currently slowly moving away from our star system and is moving towards the direction of the solar system, but we still don’t know its specific orbit. Perhaps we can try to catch up with it.

        #ASSEX_Q'geleetA_name = Q'geleet A
		#ASSEX_Q'geleetA_desc = Q'geleet A is the primary star of this star system. It is a K-type star. At present, it still has a long life span and can continue to emit light and heat stably. In a relatively close orbit, there is a companion star that is about half the size of it. Due to the high mass and the close distance of its companion star, the center of mass of the entire star system is located inside its primary star. Despite this, we still judge it as a binary star system.  \n \n Please note that since the two stars are very close to each other and are disturbed by strong force fields, please do not try to get close to the star!

        #ASSEX_Q'geleetB_name = Q'geleetB
		#ASSEX_Q'geleetB_desc =Q'geleet B is a companion star to Q'geleet A. It is about half the size of its primary star in terms of visual appearance. It is also redder and dimmer than the primary star. It takes about 24 hours for it to orbit the primary star. At such a close distance, it and the primary star are tidally locked by strong tidal forces, with only one side facing each other.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_b_desc = This is a hot Jupiter. It used to be much larger than it is today in terms of volume and mass. However, due to the fierce stellar winds blown by two stars, its atmosphere is being blown away bit by bit. This is also As a result, the planet's mass is slowly disappearing. Now almost 90% of its atmosphere has been blown away, and it won't be long before an iron rock core will be exposed.  \n\n<color=#FF9700> Its atmosphere has been heated to a very high temperature by the two stars. The intense high temperature has caused the clouds in the atmosphere to begin to burn, emitting a dark red light. At the same time, a hurricane with a speed of dozens of times faster than the speed of sound has been blown up in the planet's atmosphere. If you try to enter its atmosphere, please be careful.

        #ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_c_name = Q'geleet AB - c
		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_c_desc = As the two stars below entangled with each other, releasing weak gravity to distort space and time, the rotation of this purple-red world began to slow down gradually, and the hydrogen in its atmosphere became less and less under the erosion of stellar winds.... \n The composition of the clouds of this gas world is almost exactly the same as that of our home world. Perhaps on this distant alien world, it will also rain or snow like on Mars. It is precisely because of the large amount of these water vapor clouds that this gas planet has become the second most reflective existence in this star system.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_d_desc = This planet is the third planet we have discovered in this binary star system. It is also the most distant and largest gas planet in this star system. It is different from other gas planets in this system. It belongs to the same type of planet as Jupiter and Saturn in the solar system, that is, a Jovian planet, not an ice giant. Because of its distance from its parent star, it is not tidally locked. Even so, we still can't explain why it spins so slowly. \n \n Its climate is very unique. We have found many white spots of various sizes in the south pole and north pole of the planet, and these white spots have never appeared near the equator. We speculate that these white spots are big storms on this gas planet.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_e_desc = This planet is the fourth planet we have discovered in this star system, so it is codenamed [AB]-e. This planet is the smallest gas planet in this star system in terms of mass and volume, so it is classified as a "mini-Neptune". Because it is so small, when we first discovered this planet, we once thought it was a super-Earth, but subsequent investigations overturned this argument. \n\n At present, its atmosphere has become hundreds of thousands of times thinner. Perhaps our spacecraft can withstand the current atmospheric pressure and dive into its core? \n\n<color=#FF000C> Analysis here shows that its atmosphere is already so thin that we can completely enter its atmosphere and reach its core. Even so, you can't dive too fast, or you may die.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_g_desc = This frozen world once held its last glimmer of life tens of millions of years ago, but the fall of the satellite destroyed the last balance. The shock wave destroyed everything on the surface. The splashed material formed a huge halo around the planet, but this halo fell one after another thousands of years ago, once again causing fatal damage to the surface. Until now, you can find many huge impact craters near the equator of this planet. \n \n<color=#C864BE> The sea of ​​the past has long been frozen, leaving only imagination and memories for future generations;

It moves along a highly eccentric elliptical orbit around the planet below, which has a mass almost the same as that of the Earth.
