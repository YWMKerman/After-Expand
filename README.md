AfterSolarSystemExpand or After Expand (ASSEX for short) is a mod based on the timeline of AfterSolarSystemMod. This mod adds dozens of stars to the solar system. Some of these stars have a large number of stars, some have only a few planets, or no planets; some star systems contain one or more stars, both binary star systems or multiple star systems; there are even black holes or wandering planets. These stars or planets are diverse. These stars or planets are diverse, and their stars cover a large part of the star spectrum types in the Hertz-Rubber diagram, and the planet types cover almost all types of planets currently known to mankind. Some planets are extremely cold, and the hydrosphere on the surface is liquid hydrogen, while some planets are oceans composed of liquid nitrogen. And some planets are ordinary liquid water, or lava... 

Compared with AfterSolarSystem, ASSEX has exerted imagination to a great extent. But not all planets are unscientific and unreasonable. Their existence is physically simulated to ensure the stability of the system before they are added into the game. All celestial bodies are in the proportion of the universe in our real life, without any size scaling.

But it should be noted that when you go to these exoplanets, do not directly use the cheat function to transfer your vehicle directly to the surface of the exoplanet with an atmosphere, because this is likely to cause game bugs and your vehicle Tools will be destroyed by air resistance. At the same time, if you teleport directly, the texture of the planet's surface will not be loaded in time, and a mosaic-like surface texture will appear. In general, it is recommended that when you use the cheat function to go to these planets, you first teleport to the orbit of the planet you want to land, and then manually land or use the cheat function again to teleport to the surface.Another thing to mention is that after KerbalSpaceProgram version 1.8, the game changed the way terrain is generated, which means that when you go to extremely distant planets, the accuracy will overflow, which means there will be terrain faults, or you will not be able to drive a vehicle, or you will not be able to drive a vehicle. Or your vehicle will be destroyed not far from the ground. But this seems to be probabilistic? It has not happened on my computer.

Finally, ASSEX is not entirely built by YWMKerman, the author of AfterSolarSystem. It is theoretically a fan work of AfterSolarSystem, completed by Linhu Fox, and YWMKerman is responsible for collaboration and technical support. Due to optimization and Mod size issues, if you feel that the content quality is far inferior to AfterSolarSystem, please understand.

# _***Content :***_
_ASSEX adds a large number of extrasolar stars and planets to AfterSolarSystem. Due to space constraints, we cannot list them one by one. The following is a selection of star systems to show you their system conditions and planets and star types.:_


- ## ***ω Milkdromeda System***
![three](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a24d4c-5d5d-46f6-99eb-d99f8e69fba7)
  _**（A multi-star system consisting of three stars: a white dwarf, a red giant that is larger and brighter than the sun, and a slightly more distant red dwarf. In the orbit closer to the red giant, there is a planet with a higher temperature and greater gravity. Its atmosphere becomes thinner due to the stellar wind of the red giant, so it would be difficult to reach it. The slightly more distant red dwarf has two planets, a super Earth and an ice giant. That super-Earth may be a world with habitable temperatures. It is the closest to us and the first place you can go after leaving the solar system）**_


  - ## ***Q' geleet System***
![TWO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f14685c-d051-478f-a1c6-7aaa8ad5184f)
  _**（This is a binary star system a little far from us. It contains a planet with liquid water on its surface, but the current environment has seriously deteriorated; in addition, there is a vacuum world with huge gravity; a mini-Neptune whose core you can reach; a super-Earth planet with an extremely large volume but a very thin atmosphere. They all revolve around the pair of stars. It is a binary star system of a pair of K-type stars and an M-type star.)**_



  - ## ***SEQ 0139-1757/J1 System***
![1647](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aee1b15f-4e2a-498d-ae46-4a6063171098)
_**(A star system similar to Kepler-1647b. It has a gas planet similar to Jupiter orbiting two stars similar to our current sun. Its rotation axis and orbital period are similar to our current earth. The most special thing is that this gas planet is located in the habitable zone of its parent star. It also has three satellites with large mass, one of which has an atmosphere and a temperature very close to our current earth. Another is a giant vacuum satellite with a radius similar to that of the earth, and another is a satellite slightly larger than the moon. There is also an irregular satellite farther away, providing fuel for the starship that arrives here.)**_
    
 - ## ***Moryan System***
![Morleng](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32739edf-b194-40b3-b299-fc5008fa4d7a)
_**(An F9V main sequence star with multiple large planets, among which the satellite Morleng of the gas giant Moryann is a potential harbor for life. In addition, there is a high-gravity celestial body with 6 times the mass of the Earth and 1.5 times the radius of the Earth, a super ocean planet with about 15 times the mass of the Earth, a gas giant with 5 times the mass of Jupiter, and so on... They add a lot of challenges to the lonely game.)**_
