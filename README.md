_"AEX is not just about exploring stars — it’s about exploring time itself.
See what our cosmic neighborhood might look like billions of years from now."_

AfterExpand (AEX) is a Kerbal Space Program (KSP) mod that expands upon the AfterSolarSystem project.
It adds at least 10 scientifically plausible nearby star systems for you to explore — all modeled as they might appear billions of years in the future, when the Sun has evolved into its red giant stage.
_**In AEX, the positions of nearby stars are assumed to remain roughly unchanged. Based on that, the mod presents a speculative but realistic future snapshot of the solar neighborhood, featuring:**_

-	Alpha Centauri System – now consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf

-	Barnard’s Star – still on the main sequence.

-	Sirius System – both stars have ended their lives as white dwarfs.

-	Epsilon Eridani (ε Eri) – nearing the end of its main sequence phase.

-	Tau Ceti (τ Cet) – evolving toward a subgiant state. 

- ...

Unlike purely fictional expansions, AEX maintains a balance between realism and fun, offering an immersive scientific experience without unnecessary exaggerations.
For instance, planets like TRAPPIST-1b won’t feature unrealistically thick atmospheres — atmospheric models are designed to be scientifically grounded yet engaging.
In addition to real-world stars, AEX includes several fictional systems created by collaborator Linfox.
While fictional, their planetary architectures, atmospheres, and physical parameters still follow realistic astrophysical principles.
*Don’t like fictional systems?*
*No problem — you can disable them entirely in the mod’s configuration settings.*

AEX is designed as a counterpart to RealExpand, but with a stronger emphasis on scientific consistency and future plausibility.
It’s meant to complement the AfterSolarSystem mod, extending your journey beyond the far-future Sun into the wider cosmos.

 ### Known Limitations
Due to KSP’s floating origin and precision issues, you may encounter graphical artifacts such as:
- “cracked” terrain
- surface “mosaic” glitches
- or physics instability

These effects become more common when you travel several light-years away from the original solar system.
 ***Tip: If you use the in-game console to teleport a vessel directly to a distant star system,
these issues will almost certainly occur.
To minimize them, first teleport your craft into a high, stable orbit around the target Body,
then manually descend to the surface.***
