        #ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_name = α Cen System
		#ASSEX_ωMilkBarycenter_desc = A binary star system, once the closest to the solar system, consisted of two stars with masses similar to our Sun and a red dwarf. Near this red dwarf, a planet similar to Earth, considered a potential harbor for life, was discovered. \nAt that time, this system aroused a lot of people's desire to explore, even though this star system is far away from us...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_A_name = α Cen A
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_A_desc = This star long ago shed its massive outer shell. This seemingly tiny, fiery object is the remains of Alpha Centauri A. After the star's death, it has lost all its energy source and is rapidly cooling... \n Despite its rapid cooling, it will still take a long time for it to completely transform into a black dwarf and disappear before our very eyes. For now, the faint light is like a long-burning lamp...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_B_name = α Cen B
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_B_desc = Alpha Centauri B is now at the peak of its lifespan, also its most unstable. It is now larger and brighter than ever before. \nAt this moment, it is bright enough to serve as a beacon to guide you on nearby interstellar voyages. \n\n<color=#864817>The brightest star in the night sky, please shine as I move forward.

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_C_name = Proxima 
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_C_desc = In the past, Proxima Centauri was the closest star to the solar system. It is a red dwarf star. Because it is so small and dim, even though it is only 4 light-years away from us, we cannot observe it directly with the naked eye. \nBut thanks to its tiny mass and dim light, Proxima Centauri burns very slowly. Even now, it is still in the main sequence stage, and has only completed less than 1/10 of the main sequence star lifespan. We anticipate it still has a long, long way to go...

        #ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_name = ω Milkdromeda C b
		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cd_desc = A super-Earth in the habitable zone, it was once considered one of the closest terrestrial planets to the solar system and the first stop on humanity's interstellar journey... From a distant observer, it appears to have a habitable temperature and lies within its parent star's habitable zone. However, its parent star is a red dwarf. Even if the planet initially possessed a thick atmosphere and liquid water, the atmosphere would have become increasingly thinner with each powerful flare. In the end, it didn't have the ability to hold on until Proxima Centauri entered a stable phase... \n\nAlthough it still had an atmosphere at this moment, it was no longer useful. The extremely low air pressure was not suitable for the existence and development of life. Nevertheless, it remains a landmark, commemorating humanity's first steps outside the solar system and a milestone in human planetary colonization...

		#ASSEX_ωMilk_Cc_desc = This planet is dry and hot, orbiting Proxima Centauri in a roughly five-day orbit. At such a close distance, we believe it's tidally locked to its parent star, with one side permanently faci。 \n However, such a small planet would have little ability to maintain an atmosphere, so we assume it's extremely dry. But perhaps we could find some solid ice on the dark side?

        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_name = Proxima c
        #ASS_ωMilk_Cb_desc = This is an ice giant orbiting a distant red dwarf star. Although its orbital semi-major axis is only about 1.5 AU, its parent star is an extremely dim red dwarf star, which makes this ice giant shrouded in darkness almost all the time. This means that we have almost no way to get a glimpse of its true appearance. Now, we have discovered that this ice giant is surrounded by a faint halo, which reflects a dim blue light from sunlight...

		#ASSEX_ShuGeer_desc = This is a red dwarf star with a very large motion in the sky, passing by our solar system at a very fast speed. In the past, this star system was the second star system that humans left the solar system and headed into the vast universe...

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerd_name = Barnard's Star d
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerd_desc = This is a hot, dry vacuum world. This vacuum rocky planet may be the closest planet to its parent star. At such a close distance, even if its parent star is a red dwarf, it will still be affected by its strong thermal radiation. In addition, it is tidally locked to the parent star. We estimate that there is an extreme temperature difference between the sun-facing side and the dark side of this planet, and the temperature on the sun-facing side can be as high as 500 degrees Celsius! \n\nAlthough its color appears to be flaming, we do not consider it a dangerous world.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerb_name = Barnard's Star b
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerb_desc = This is a celestial body destroyed by a red dwarf star. During the pre-main sequence stage that lasted for hundreds of millions of years, the frequent flares of the star and the solar wind eruptions continuously stripped away its atmosphere and weakened its magnetic field. Eventually, the original thick atmosphere of the planet disappeared completely. If there was water on this planet, it would have evaporated. Now, it has become a dry world. \n But on the other side of the planet, where the star can never shine, there may still be solidified water.

        #ASSEX_ShuGeerc_name = Barnard's Star c
		#ASSEX_ShuGeerc_desc = This old planet was destroyed by a violent solar flare that erupted from this star system billions of years ago. We believe that even if this planet had an atmosphere in the past, it would not have lasted long because the planet is so small. Therefore, perhaps within tens of millions of years after the planet formed, its atmosphere was blown away by the strong stellar wind... \n Today, the planet is cold and dead, although tidally locked, the temperature on its dayside has risen to a level that seems suitable for life...

        #ASSEX_ShuGeere_name = Barnard's Star e
		#ASSEX_ShuGeere_desc = Today, this cold world still has an extremely thin atmosphere. According to our investigation, this atmosphere is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Perhaps because of this, these "heavy gases" are not blown away by the stellar wind. \n\nBut we can still be sure that this is still a lifeless world...

        #ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_name = Sirius System
		#ASSEX_Irius_Barycenter_desc = Both stars in this star system have died. Now they have become a pair of white dwarfs, relying on each other for survival and orbiting each other... Now they have disappeared from people's sight. Although they have gone far away from us, we may not forget the pair of stars that were once the brightest.

        #ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_name = Sirius A
		#ASSEX_IriusA_Barycenter_desc = A star most famous in the 21st century AD. At that time, it was the brightest in the night sky, and countless poems and verses have been written about it, both in ancient China and the West... However, this star was so bright that its lifespan was extremely short. Although younger than the Sun at the time, it entered the white dwarf phase much earlier. Today, that once brightest star has faded from view, and as it cools, it is also being forgotten.

        #ASSEX_IriusB_name = Sirius B
		#ASSEX_IriusB_desc = This is the most massive white dwarf we have discovered so far, and its mass almost approaches the upper limit of its mass as a white dwarf. This white dwarf is already very old. Billions of years after its formation, it slowly cooled... and gradually faded from view.

        #ASSEX_Ruanxiao_name = Epsilon Eridani
		#ASSEX_Ruanxiao_desc = This is a K-type main-sequence star that was once relatively close to us. It's not too far away, but its light is so dim that it's barely visible to the naked eye. Despite its dim appearance, its smaller mass means it has a much longer lifespan than our own Sun. Therefore, searching for potentially habitable Earth-like planets around K-type stars is a goal, as they are both long-lived and far more stable than the more volatile red dwarfs. Although this star system does not contain any potentially habitable planets, it can still be a target for exploration.

        #ASSEX_Ruanxiaob_name = Epsilon Eridani b
		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaob_desc = Epsilon Eridani b is a celestial body orbiting the K-type star Epsilon Eridani. This planet is the first planet we have discovered in this star system and may also be the only one in this star system. Judging from its appearance, its mass and volume are very close to Jupiter, a gas planet in the solar system. \nBut as a gas planet, it is obviously impossible for life to survive here.

        #ASSEX_Ruanxiaobb_name = Epsilon Eridani bb
		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaobb_desc = This is a cold, frozen world orbiting the giant gas planet below. From the outside, it appears smooth and flawless. If you just look at the appearance, this cold world not only has a thin atmosphere, but also extremely low temperatures, which is not suitable for the existence of life at all. But what if life does not exist above the surface? Instead, what if it exists in the ocean beneath the thick ice? \nBecause this object's orbit has a certain eccentricity, we believe this would generate large tidal forces, heating the object and causing it to melt deep within, thus forming an alien deep ocean like Enceladus in the past...

		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaobc_desc = It's a tiny, frozen world, perhaps the smallest moon in this planetary system, and it's just plain boring?  \nBut beneath this ordinary appearance lies the most bizarre landforms. It's almost impossible to find a flat place on this miniature world. If you try to land here, please be careful.

		#ASSEX_Ruanxiaobd_desc = This is a distant icy satellite, perhaps the outermost icy satellite in this planetary system. We have always known very little about the celestial bodies in this system. At one time, we couldn't even see what it looked like, so our understanding of it was limited to the information of its mass.

        #ASSEX_Ceticus_name = Tau Ceti
		#ASSEX_Ceticus_desc = This ancient star was once hailed as the most Sun-like star, boasting a similar mass and spectrum to our Sun and hosting multiple rocky planets. In the early 21st century, it was considered a suitable haven for immigrants. Today, the star is nearing the end of its main sequence phase, and its brightness is gradually increasing, which may be a disaster for planets close to it.

        #ASSEX_τCetg_name = Tau Ceti g
		#ASSEX_τCetg_desc = This scorching planet is nearing the end of its lifespan. The intense heat from its parent star has melted the rocks on its surface into flowing lava. \nIt won't be long before its parent star leaves the main sequence stage and enters the red giant stage, at which point it will inevitably be devoured.    \n\n<color=#3A3E00>Please don't try to land on those lava rocks, they are dangerous!

		#ASSEX_τCeth_desc =  Tau Ceti h is a huge vacuum world, and the deep gravity well seems to be announcing to the outside that it will prevent any object from approaching. For this planet, any spacecraft attempting to land is almost impossible, and most of those who have tried to explore here have ended up crashing into the surface of this celestial body at high speed due to exhaustion of fuel. \n\nIf you attempt to explore here, be careful.

Millions of years ago, its temperature began to climb as the star continued to brighten. At a certain point, the temperature continued to rise... And now, this thick atmosphere is the product of this out-of-control situation. We believe that at this moment, you won't be able to find a single drop of water on this world...

		#ASSEX_Ceticusf_desc = Tau Ceti f is a super-Earth in a distant orbit, with a semi-major axis of approximately 1.334 AU. As its star gradually brightens and its habitable zone shifts outward, the planet's exposure to radiation increases, causing the long-solidified liquid water to slowly melt.

Due to the unique inclination of the planetary disk of this star system, we cannot observe it through the traditional "transit method", but it is observed and confirmed by the "radial velocity method".

		#ASSEX_Gliless581_desc = Gliless 581 is a famous star system. In the past, it was confirmed to have a planet that was said to be 100% habitable, which was named after it, although it was later confirmed that it was an observation error. Still, there's a chance, however remote, that this massive red dwarf star could harbor potentially habitable planets.

        #ASSEX_Gliless581b_name = Gliese581 b
        #ASSEX_Gliless581b_desc = This is a vibrant blue ice giant, visually surpassing Neptune in our own solar system and the oceans of our home planet. But its deep blue color is not due to its atmospheric methane, but because it is a hot Neptune...

As a result, Gliese581 e is subject to strong tidal forces. Every few days, the powerful gravitational pull will tug on the object, and this process will continue indefinitely. As a result, the planet's geology will always be extremely active... Today, this giant planet has become an extremely hot and humid death world.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gb_desc= This dark red vacuum object is a companion to the giant rocky planet below. It formed with that planet. At the beginning of its formation, it was located more distant than it is today, but as time went by, it began to slowly approach the main star. As it approached, the tidal force generated by the two giant planets also caused their rotation speed to become faster and faster. Slowly and slowly, now, while they remain where they are now, the two of them are also tidally locked to each other. It reflects a dark red glow in the light of the star below, but we wouldn't normally think of it as a dangerous world.  \n\n<color=#A30000> Need to be careful! The surface of this vacuum bare rock world is very uneven, with a large number of craters and uneven hills. If you try to make a soft landing instead of an emergency landing, please be careful.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gc_desc = This is a dark red asteroid in a relatively distant orbit, and under normal circumstances you can barely see it because it's so small and so dim due to its low albedo. \nAlthough it looks small, its mass is very high compared to other asteroids of equal radius. In this case, a large part of the material that makes up its surface is metal or even entirely composed of metal. This is going to be a huge space gem for us. If we can get close to it and mine it, we may be able to extract many precious metals.

		#ASSEX_Q'geleetAB_gd_desc = This massive fragment is the second-largest moon in the planetary system (if you include its companion star) and the largest in the entire star system. But its composition is completely different from other satellites. Its main component is ice, which is why it is so huge and has such a low mass. \n But in fact, we still don't know why there is such a large "radius" cliff in this star system? That is, the radius of the celestial body suddenly jumps directly from about 100 kilometers to thousands of kilometers, and no celestial body with any intermediate value can be found.
